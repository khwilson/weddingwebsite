    <h2>Where to stay</h2>
    <p>We have reserved a block of rooms at the <a href="http://www.seelbachhilton.com/">Seelbach Hotel</a> in Downtown Louisville. To reserve a room in the block, click <a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/hi/groups/personalized/S/SDFSHHF-SWW-20181026/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG">here</a> or call 1-800-333-3399 and use the code 'SWW'. Rooms in our block are available Wednesday, October 25 through Sunday, October 28, in case you'd like to make a long weekend out of the trip.</p>
    <p>The Seelbach also provides a complimentary shuttle from the Louisville airport running every half hour between 4am and 11pm. They recommend calling (502) 585-3200 the day of your flight to reserve a spot. Alternatively, a Lyft or Uber will run you about $15.</p>
    <p>Please note that if you would like a room in the block, you must make a reservation before September 24.</p>
    <p>All events other than the wedding itself are either close to downtown or at the Seelbach. So if you would prefer another hotel, we recommend booking no further away than Jeffersontown.</p>
