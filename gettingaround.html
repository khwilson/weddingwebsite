    <h2>Airports</h2>
    <p>There are three airports within 1.5 hours of the Wilson family farm in Shelbyville and the hotel block in Louisville. They are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Louisville (SDF): 10 minutes from the hotel; 35 minutes from the farm.</li>
      <li>Lexington (LEX): 70 minutes from the hotel; 55 minutes from the farm.</li>
      <li>Cincinnati (CVG): 90 minutes from the hotel; 90 minutes from the farm.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to stay</h2>
    <p>We have reserved a block of rooms at the Seelbach Hotel in Downtown Louisville. Click <a href="http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/groups/personalized/S/SDFSHHF-SWW-20181026/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG">here</a> to reserve a room in the block.</p>
    <p>We anticipate all events other than the wedding itself being closer to downtown. So if you would prefer another hotel, we recommend booking no further away than Jeffersontown.</p>

    <h2>Getting around</h2>
    <p>Uber and Lyft both serve the Louisville area, but getting a car far from the downtown core (like in Shelbyville) can be difficult. We will run shuttles from the Seelbach to the farm, but if you want to explore the Louisville area, we highly recommend renting a car.</p>
    <p>If you would like help finding a car rental buddy, please email either Kevin or Chan.</p>
