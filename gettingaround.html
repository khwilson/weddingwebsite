    <h2>Getting around</h2>
    <p>We will run shuttles from the Seelbach to the farm and back. However, if you want to explore the Louisville area for bourbon tastings, horse riding, hiking, climbing, or other activities, we highly recommend renting a car. (The Seelbach has a parking garage.)</p>
    <p>If you would like help finding a car rental buddy, please email either Kevin or Chan.</p>
