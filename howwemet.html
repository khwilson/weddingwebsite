    <h2>How we met</h2>
    <p>Kevin and Chan met the old-fashioned way: on a dating website. Chan messaged Kevin first, his opening gambit being tobacco-related tax policies of the mid-90s. Of course, on their first date at a Union Square coffeeshop in New York, Kevin proceeded to quiz Chan about a Supreme Court opinion handed down the day before. The fun and merriment continued with an impromptu second date at a Slate podcast event on LGBT issues. And thus began hopefully many years of yelling at each other instead of clouds.</p>
