    <p>Kentucky is a great place to visit for all sorts of reasons. Depending on how long you want to stay in or around town, there are several excursions to take. Here we list both things you can do before the wedding on Saturday (marked with a ??? glyph) and some that are a bit farther afield if you're thinking of sticking around a bit (marked with a ??? glyph). All times listed are from the Seelbach.</p>

    <h2>Bourbon</h2>
      <p>Kentucky is the home of bourbon, and distilleries love to show you around. We recommend you go to a few to compare. The distilleries are generally clumped around Lousiville, Bardstown, and Versailles. What follows are some distilleries and "experiences" in each region.</p>
      <p>The Bardstown and Versailles clusters require driving. One option is to rent a limo for a day, which can run between $50 and $100 per person depending on how fancy you want to be and how many people are going. If you would like to sign up for a limo with other wedding guests, please fill out <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/Sb3gYuCoQq6qAZfq2">this survey</a> and the grooms will coordinate.</p>
    <h3>Louisville</h3>
      <p>There are several micro-distilleries and "bourbon experiences" very close to downtown Louisville. Ride hailing will probably be sufficient to get around.
      <ul>
        <li>Angel's Envy Distillery</li>
        <li>Evan Williams Experience</li>
        <li>Jim Beam Microdistillery</li>
        <li>Bulleit Experience</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Bardstown</h3>
      <p>Bardstown is about 45 minutes from Downtown Louisville and the distilleries are a bit farther apart from each other. On the other hand, it is home to more active distilleries than downtown, and you just might prefer their bourbons.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jim Beam Distillery</li>
        <li>Four Roses Bottling and Warehousing</li>
        <li>Old Heaven Hill Distillery</li>
        <li>Willett Distillery</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Versailles</h3>
      <p>Versailles is about an hour from Downtown Louisville and the distilleries are a bit farther apart from each other. On the other hand, it is home to more active distilleries than downtown, and you just might prefer their bourbons.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Buffalo Trace Distillery</li>
        <li>Four Roses Distillery</li>
        <li>Wild Turkey Distillery</li>
        <li>Woodford Reserve Distillery</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Horses</h2>
      <p>Kentucky is also the center of the world's thoroughbred industry. This consists of two major racetracks as well as several major farms. Some of the industry is in Louisville, but much of it is in Lexington, a little over an hour east of downtown. Here are some potential things to see.
      <h3>Churchill Downs</h3>
        <p>The home of the Kentucky Derby, Churchill Downs is probably the most famous horse racetrack. On October 27, however, there will be no live racing, but it is open for tours, including the Derby museum. (If you stick around until the next weekend, though, the Breeder's Cup will be racing on the first Friday and Saturday in November.)</p>
      <h3>Keeneland</h3>
        <p>The lesser known but probably more important track is Keeneland, located in Lexington, Kentucky. All October racing in Kentucky happens at Keeneland's Fall Meet. From October 5 through October 27, there are live races every day but Monday and Tuesday. Tours are also avaiable if booked ahead of time <a href="https://tickets.keeneland.com/clubderby/Online/default.asp">at Keeneland's website</a>. If you're willing to get up a bit early, the <a href="https://tickets.keeneland.com/clubderby/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=BehindtheScenesRacingTour&BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=&=">racing tour</a>.
      <h3>Horse Farms</h3>
        <p>There are several horse farms in the Lexington area, including the farm where American Pharoah, the last Triple Crown winner, hangs out and collects stud fees. Unfortunately, we're a little early to book fall tours of horse farms at the moment, but keep them in mind if you're going to Keeneland.</p>

    <h2>Louisville Museums</h2>
      <p>Louisville has several great museums that Kevin remembers from his childhood. They are all located within walking or cabbing distance from the Seelbach, and so can make for a relaxing Saturday.
      <h3>Slugger Museum</h3>
        <p>One of Louisville's primary exports is Louisville Slugger baseball bats. The factory has a museum attached to it, showcasing many of the bats used by baseball's greatest players.</p>
      <h3>Kentucky Science Center</h3>
        <p>Kevin loves science museums. Like all science museums, this one is aimed at kids, but it makes it no less fun.</p>
      <h3>Speed Museum</h3>
        <p>The Speed Museum is the largest art museum in the Louisville area, located on the University of Louisville's campus. A free highlights tour occurs on Saturdays at 1pm.</p>

    <h2>Food</h2>
      <p>Louisville is home to some great restaurants. Of late, the most famous chef from the city is Ed Lee, whose two restaurants, 610 Magnolia and Milkwood, are amazing. Also great is Proof on Main.
